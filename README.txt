Project Read-me.

Project : A Text Simplifier API
Author : Muhammad Adil

Description : This software takes the user input and swap the words with their synonyms from the Googe-1000 words which are most common words in english langauge.

Classes : I used these following classes in this program.
			01. ConsoleColour
			02. FilePath
			03. GoogleParse
			04. Menu
			05. Runner
			06. ThesaurusParser
			07. UserInputMap
			

ConsoleColour:  It's just to show the words in different color of the text in console that have been changed with a synonym.

FilePath: This class is used to choose the file from the system and read the path of the file instead of typing the file path manually. File path could be chosen from systems directory at any location. Filedialoge has been used to perform the task.

GoogleParse: This class reads the file from system and adds it to the map (To swap the words with their synonyms) and the list (All the words from Google-1000.txt).
This class uses a method called parse(); which returns a map( Map<String, String> map) and this method runs in linear time because while loop has to go
through each line one by one till the end of file and returns IOException.

Menu: This class is just used to display the instructions to the user how to run the program step by step. and provides diffrent options to perform diffrent tasks in the program.

I use following methods in this class.
	i. One method provides the menu to its user and process the data after the user input
 	ii. Second method takes the user input whether user wants to proceed or not it user wants to proceed with the programs it prompts the instructions to the user

Runner: This class has main method which is used to run the whole program.

ThesaurusParser: This Class has a method parse(); which finds the match between the words in the array of words (Thesaurus) and list of Google words.This method runs in linear time because loop has to go over each word one by one and It return the word if there is a match otherwise it returns null.

UserInputMap: This class is used to take the user input and the maps generated by the parsed files to swap the synonyms to the words.This method takes the user input as String and swap the words which are synonym in the google file.This method (swapping(String text)) runs in Linear time because it loops over the each item in the map one by one.This method returns the text back but with swapped synonyms.


Extra Work: Filepath class is completey extra in this project which was not in the requirments and this class helps choosing th efiles from the systems directory at any location.
